# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AgentTeam is an AI-powered multi-agent system that simulates a professional software development team. The system currently features **AgentIan**, an intelligent Product Owner agent that:

- ü§ñ Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for intelligent project analysis
- üí¨ Conducts interactive requirements gathering via Slack
- üîç Improves human responses with AI text enhancement
- üìã Creates professional user stories in Jira with acceptance criteria
- üéØ Provides transparent AI analysis and project insights

## Development Environment

### Core Technologies
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: AI-powered analysis, text improvement, and story generation
- **LangGraph**: AI workflow orchestration framework
- **Jira**: Professional project management system for user stories and issue tracking  
- **Slack**: Communication platform for human-agent interaction
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment with simplified docker-compose
- **Python 3.11**: Primary development language

### Essential Commands

#### Running the System
```bash
# Full interactive workflow (recommended)
python langgraph/main.py

# Debug Slack integration only
python langgraph/main.py --debug-slack  

# Test interactive response system
python langgraph/main.py --test-interactive

# Show help and usage
python langgraph/main.py --help
```

#### Docker Operations
```bash
# Run AgentIan in production mode
docker-compose up agentian

# Build and run AgentIan with fresh container
docker-compose up --build agentian

# Run in development mode (keeps container running)
docker-compose up agentian-dev

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f agentian

# Run specific commands in dev container
docker-compose exec agentian-dev python main.py --debug-slack
```

#### Development and Testing
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
cd langgraph && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Python tests
cd langgraph && python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
cd langgraph && python test_slack_integration.py

# Code formatting (available tools)
cd langgraph && black .
cd langgraph && flake8 .
```

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```bash
# Core Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key               # For future LLM integration
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token          # Slack bot token
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C-your-channel-id           # Target Slack channel

- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for easy addition of new agent roles (Developer, Tester, DevOps)
- **Status**: Production-ready, actively used for project requirements gathering

### Testing Strategy

1. **Slack Integration**: Test message sending/receiving with `--debug-slack`
2. **Interactive Workflow**: Test complete response cycle with `--test-interactive` 
3. **Full Workflow**: End-to-end testing with actual project goals and Jira integration
4. **Docker Testing**: Use `agentian-test` service for containerized testing
5. **Jira Integration**: Verify story creation, issue management, and project tracking

### Important Setup Notes

#### Jira API Token Creation
1. Go to your Atlassian account: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Create a new API token
3. Use your email as username and the token as password for API calls

#### Project Setup
- Create a Jira project with type "Software Development" 
- Note the project key (e.g., "AT" for "Agent Team")
- Ensure "Story" issue type is available in your project

### Archived Components

Legacy code and experimental features are stored in the `archive/` directory:
- **archive/taiga-legacy/**: Original Taiga integration code and duplicate files  
- **archive/scripts/**: Development and debugging scripts

### Future Expansion

The architecture is designed to support additional agents:
- AgentPete (Developer)
- AgentSarah (Tester)
- AgentMike (DevOps)
- Additional specialized roles

Each agent will follow the same pattern of LangGraph workflows, Jira integration, and Slack communication for professional team collaboration.
